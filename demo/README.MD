  3. We try to import an index.scss file inside javascript, webpack shows that you need an appropriate loader to handle this fyle type
  - Test removing the loaders inside module rules
  - we then install css loader , style loader and sass loader
  - added box inside html and applied styling
  - Check bundle with arrow function inside app1.bundle before applying babel 
  - added babel loader with transform object , installed babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env

  - We are still working with index.html file for production mode
