1. Webpack initalization
  - We will create a package json with npm init to initalize the package 
  - We will then install webpack 
  - Webpack installation is done with webpack cli npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
  - We create a src map where we will add the entry point, default is index.js. 
  - Now we will createa a webpack config inside map config where all our magic will be there
  - After that we added command to run webpack with target webpack.dev.js
  - The result will show in dist map after runnin npm run buid or yarn build
