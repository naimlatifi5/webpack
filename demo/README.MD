   -Added entry points 
   - Tested with multiple entry points as entry object 
   - Checked what happens if we remove [name] from filename output, we will see wepback will generate error as it can not have multiple chunks to the same filename.
   - added lodash dependency.
   - We add an index.html directly to dist map  and link our created bundle to see the result on browser and preparin for now only for production
   - We open the index.html file manually to open the result in the browser

   - We see the result in the console
