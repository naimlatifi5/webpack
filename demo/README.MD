1. Webpack initalization
  - We will create a package json with npm init and where 
  - After we have initalized our package.json we install webpack 
  - Install webpack itself with webpack cli npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
  - We will create a src map where we will add the entry point. 
  - Now we will createa a webpack config inside map config where all our magic will be there
  - After that we added command to run webpack with target webpack.dev.js with npm run build
